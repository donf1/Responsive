      <p>My name is Don Feeney and I’m currently a student at Penn LPS Boot Camp in Philadelphia. My goal is to
        complete the
        required coursework from the program and become a Front End Web Developer. I’m passionate when it comes
        to learning and
        finding solutions to challenging problems. I graduated from Pennsylvania State University with a BS in
        Business.
        I’m calm under pressure and like to see tasks completed on time. I’m an asset to any team because I’m
        supportive, I like
        to be part of a common goal, and I enjoy collaboration and brainstorming with others.</p>
